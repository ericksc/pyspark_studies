To interact with HDFS (and fix the permissions issue), you need to use HDFS CLI commands, not Unix file commands like cd or ls.

What You Need to Do Instead
Run these HDFS commands inside the NameNode container:

1. Enter the NameNode container

docker exec -it namenode bash

2. Run HDFS commands

Create the HDFS directory:

hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/jovyan

Set ownership to the jovyan user (used by Jupyter)

hdfs dfs -chown jovyan /user/jovyan

3. (Optional) Check permissions

hdfs dfs -ls /user
